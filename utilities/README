This directory contains code for converting hypergraph files into the
binary format used by Parkway. The following formats are currently
supported:

- The HMeTiS format is the text file format accepted as input by the
  hMeTiS tool.

- The PaToH format is the text file format accepted as input by the
  PaToH tool.

- The Sandia format is the format that I have encountered in
  correspondence with researchers at Sandia Labs. It appears to be
  almost the HMeTiS format.
